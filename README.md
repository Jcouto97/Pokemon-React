# POKEMON SEARCH APP - React

**SUMMARY:**

App made with the purpose of training my React skills aswell as simple design and responsivity implementations. First time I have used some of React's performance enhancing hooks, such as memo() and useCallback(). They were used in conjunction with chrome's React Devtools extension, to continuously monitor the app's performance. Equiped with a search box input for easy single Pokemon search. I also implemmented for the first time an infinite scroll. There is a paginated version on the "paginated" branch.
